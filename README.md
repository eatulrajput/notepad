# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List web application that allows users to add, view, and manage their tasks. It's designed to be a basic note-taking tool where users can jot down tasks they need to complete.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Display Tasks:** All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and clean design for easy task management.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main structure of the web application.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the application.
- `script.js`: Handles the functionality and interactivity of the to-do list.

## File Overview

### `index.html`

This file contains the HTML structure of the To-Do List application. It includes the following components:
